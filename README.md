## Learning about ML
Website: https://virgili0.github.io/  
* ML learn to perform task from data, rather than through programming. 
* AI takes in information, process it, and interact with the world (actuators)
* Problem with ML right now is that it can only "learn" from previous data. 
  * There is no thinking process. 
* AI is more appropriate for situations where the environment changes 
upredictably, and the situation is complex. Deterministic programming does work
because new rules need to be setted up, and the logic can become unmanagible.
